# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes and explore various characteristics of passengers. The analysis is divided into three main notebooks:
1. **Titanic_Data_Exploration.ipynb**: Initial exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
2. **Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb**: In-depth analysis and predictive modeling to forecast passenger survival.
3. **Titanic_Decision_Tree_Model.ipynb**: Application of a decision tree model to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to leverage statistical analysis and machine learning to determine which factors contributed most to passenger survival on the Titanic.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries included in the `requirements.txt` file.


## Libraries Used
1. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
3. seaborn: For making statistical graphics in Python.
4. sklearn: For machine learning and predictive data analysis.
